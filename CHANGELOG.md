# Changelog

<!--
Maintenance notes:
- Newest entries at the top, oldest at the bottom.
- One dated section per day of work, one bullet per shippable feature or bug fix.
- Skip pure styling/spacing tweaks (margin, width, color-only changes) and
  routine dependency bumps — only record things a user or future contributor
  would actually want to know happened.
- A bullet says what changed and briefly why/what it enables, not an
  implementation play-by-play.
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD.

## 2026-07-31

- **Collections: Year and Sequence range** — collections can set a default
  Year (mirrors the existing default Season #) and a Sequence Min/Max range.
  Once a range is set, Sequence # fields for items in that collection become
  a picker instead of a free number, and the Edit Sequence dialog shows the
  full expected range — including a trailing "missing" gap past the last
  downloaded item — not just gaps between items that already exist.
- **Library toolbar and dialog polish** — bulk-edit dialogs gained a
  resizable two-column layout on wide screens and wider dialogs overall; a
  bug where blurred thumbnails couldn't be revealed inside bulk-edit rows was
  fixed.

## 2026-07-27

- **Compare list** — a persistent shortlist of library items you're
  comparing (distinct from the existing "Compare Metadata" dialog), with a
  management page and an immersive multi-player view that plays up to 6
  items at once with synced/overridable play, pause, and volume.
- **Bulk sequence editing** — a drag-and-drop dialog for renumbering a batch
  of files at once, with reserved-gap markers, arrow-key reordering, and
  jump-to-position pickers.
- **Missing sequence number detection** — collections and the single-item
  edit dialog surface gaps in a collection's numbering (e.g. "missing: 4, 9,
  12") so incomplete series are easy to spot.

## 2026-07-26

- **Automatic backups** — scheduled settings/library backups with a
  configurable retention policy, a history table with per-run status, and
  the ability to preview or download any past backup from Settings.
